This Neural Network will be a digit recognizer for the MNIST handwriting data set. 
Heres the read me, these fist couple of commits are just gonna be initial updates and making sure Im pushing to github from google colab.
Complete MNIST Neural Net class with customizable learning rate, nueron structure, batch sizes, and epochs. Comes as a complete class with example code in the same notebook. 
The presentation created in Latex was given as part of a Math Club event for Hood College on 12/3/2025 and was made with Patrick Vasallo.
The test and train digits come from https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/overview and are from the MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) handwriting data set.
